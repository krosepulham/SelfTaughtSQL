# SelfTaughtSQL

This repository is going to contain an example database that I will utilize as I teach myself SQL. I plan on following along with [this tutorial](https://www.learnsqlonline.org/) to start with, but using [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) on my own computer instead of using the browser instance of SQLite featured on the website.
